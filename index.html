        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>
          A will is a written document that sets out what you would like to
          happen to your possessions after you die. A will must be signed and
          witnessed. When you die, your possessions are called your ‘estate’. A
          ‘testator’ is a person who writes a will. If you die without leaving a
          will, you die ‘intestate’. <hr />For crypto, you may die without leaving access
           to your keys. Here you can deposit Ether in a smart contract and enter beneficiaries. 
          Then make periodic updates to indicate you are 'still alive'. If a certain interval has passed 
          (illustrated here as 5 minutes, but may configurable) after the last 'Alive' message was received, the benefactor is presumed dead, and the funds may be distributed.
        </p>
        <p>This is not a legal will.</p>
